# DnD5E-CharGen
A work-in-progress 5E Character Sheet Generator, written entirely in C++.

Ultimately, the goal is to create a simple windowed interface to allow users to create a 5E-compatible Dungeons & Dragons character sheet.

Currently, only a bare few functions are implemented, and all but a select few are messy and text-based.  This will change as my command of C++ grows stronger.
